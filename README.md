# License Plate Recognition
I used Convolutional Neural Network to detect and read iranian license plate. The dataset was so huge so I couldn't upload it here, but you can access all the files in [my drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1swxdSFRax6gO_0Ljk9vznwphtxTjyy72?usp=drive_link).
There is also the full explanation in the [project pdf](./Project.pdf).
